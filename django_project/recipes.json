		"instructions": "Because any simple meal goes from good to great with plenty of seasoning and layering flavors on top of each other, I like to start by cooking the chicken in the same pan I cook the vegetables and make the sauce in. When the chicken cooks, it leaves behind a million little flecks of flavor in those brown bits you find at the bottom of the pan (it 's technically called frond) you want in the finished product.\n\nAfter the chicken is cooked, it 's removed from the pan and the veggies go in. I like to essentially get them started, but I also make sure they don 't cook too much, because you want them to stay nice and crisp throughout the baking process.\n\nStir in flour. Cook for a minute or two.\n\nTurn the heat off and slowly whisk in chicken stock and whole milk, making sure there are no lumps. Whisk in sherry. Use a wooden spoon to scrape all the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer until very thick, 2-3 minutes.\n\nWhile the sauce and veggies are simmering, chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces. When the sauce is thick, add chicken and season to taste with PLENTY of salt and pepper. Add frozen peas in, stir. Set aside.\n\nPlace one crust in the bottom of the prepared pan. Pour the pot pie mixture on top. Brush the bottom crust with egg wash and cover with another crust. Fold the top crust under, sealing the top and bottom crust. Crimp edges of crust. Brush the entire top with more egg wash (be generous!). If desired, sprinkle with dried thyme. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape while baking,. Bake in the oven until top crust is golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Cool for five minute before serving.\n\nCredit: AllRecipes"
